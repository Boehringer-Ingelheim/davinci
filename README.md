# Dynamic Visualization for Clinical Insights (DaVinci)

### What is DaVinci?

DaVinci provides tools to review, aggregate and visualize data to develop and deliver safe and effective treatments for patients. Instead of creating entire R/Shiny applications, DaVinci provides individual modules. Modules are functional building blocks that can be linked together into customized apps. This customization enables App Creators to build their own app according to trial-specific needs without deep R knowledge. The concept of developing loosely coupled, functional units and composing them into a larger application is subsequently referred to as modular approach.
